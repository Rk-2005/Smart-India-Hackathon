Description
Global water resources are depleting, with a looming threat of "Zero Water Day" if conservation efforts are not taken seriously.

Key Focus:
Prevent water leakage.
Build an efficient water distribution network.
Challenge:
Inspect water supply distribution lines (100-200mm diameter) to detect:
Leakages.
Pilferage.
Damage.
Other issues.
Solution:
Implement a cloud-based dashboard for:
Data analytics.
Visualization.
Report generation.
Benefits:
Enhanced service delivery and increased efficiency in repair work.
Reduced water leakage and better pipeline condition assessment.
Early detection of leaks and faster response to contamination complaints.
GIS mapping of the pipelines for better tracking and maintenance.
Streamlined management, reducing labor-intensive breakdown work.
Incorporates live inspections, image analytics, and laser projections for more accurate assessments of water supply distribution lines.
